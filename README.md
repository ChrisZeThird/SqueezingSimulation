# OPO Noise Spectrum Simulation

This project focuses on simulating the noise spectrum of an Optical Parametric Oscillator (OPO) to analyze its squeezing 
behavior as a function of wavelength to determine the amount of squeezing we expect to obtain at a specific wavelength.
It is based on the work of [Julien Laurat](https://theses.hal.science/tel-00007442), 
[Olivier Morin](https://theses.hal.science/tel-01066655) and [GaÃ«lle Keller](https://theses.hal.science/tel-00265679v2).
