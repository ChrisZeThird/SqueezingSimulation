# Creation of a squeezed states source

This repository contains scripts developed to find the optimal parameters for a chosen non-linear crystal and optical 
cavity geometry. Please note that this repository does not include the literature review or theoretical background; it is
solely focused on the practical aspect of parameter optimization.

# Install

### General information

Required python `>= 3.8` and `pip`

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Using Pycharm

If you are using Pycharm follow these simple steps:

1. On **GitHub**, click the button <span style="color:lime;"><> Code</span> and copy the link
2. On **Pycharm**, go to `Git > Clone`
3. Paste the url of the **GitHub** repository you just copied and click clone.
4. You can now access the files. The GUI should automatically ask you if you want to download the requirements


# Project organization

### Folders

* `cavity\ ` : Contains formulae and plotting function related to the optimization of the cavity parameters related to
the bandwidth and beam waist;
* `squeezing\ ` : Contains scripts related to the prediction of squeezing generated by an Optical Parametric Oscillator(OPO);
* `utils\ `: Various utility functions for plot, settings, logger, etc.


# Settings

All the settings and grouped up in a single file called `settings.yaml`. If this file is missing, create one at the
root of the repository. Below is an example:

```yaml
# Plot parameter
number_points: 500

cmap_name: 'rainbow'
alpha: 0.3

plot_bandwidth: False
plot_waist: True
plot_kaertner: False

# Wavelength
wavelength: 780e-9

# Cavity parameters
fixed_length: 600e-3
min_L: 0.2
max_L: 1.0
cavity_loss: 0.004
d_curved_min: 0
d_curved_max: 100e-3

# Transmission coefficients
min_T: 0.1
max_T: 0.3
R: 50e-3
R1: 10e-2  # for Kaertner plot
R2: 11e-2  # for Kaertner plot

# Bandwidth
central_freq: 6.0e6
range_freq: 0.1

# Crystal parameters
crystal_length: 10e-3
crystal_index: 1.8396  # PPKTP refraction index

# Squeezing parameters
omega_c: 65000000.0               # bandwidth of the cavity
threshold: 1.0
```

### Main script

To run any scripts related to cavity optimization, make sure you set at least one parameter among `plot_bandwidth` and
`plot_waist` to `True`. Then simply run `cavity\optimize_parameters.py`. 

In **Pycharm**, make sure in the configuration
that the project directory is set to the root of the repository, otherwise `utils\settings.py` will not be able to load
the `yaml` file containing new settings and will return an empty settings object. Uncomment the debugging line in 
`utils\settings.py` to check if the settings file is correctly loaded.
