# Design process of cavity-enhanced SPDC 

As part of my master thesis, I had to design a cavity for the generation of squeezed states compatible with Rubidium
atomic transition line. After reviewing the different types of cavities, and non-linear crystals, it was time to plug in
some values to see if we could already have an order of magnitude of the different parameters of the system. First the
bandwidth of the cavity determines the values of the cavity length L and the transmission coefficient of the mirrors L.
Secondly, to improve the non-linear effects of the SPDC process, we must find the right value of waist, which depends on
the mirrors reflectivity, the crystal length, and the different length of the cavity.
